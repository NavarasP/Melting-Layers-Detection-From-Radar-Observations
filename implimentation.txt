Yes ✅ — you **can** replicate the workflow from the paper with your **GPM DPR dataset**, but with some adaptations because DPR ≠ KAZR. Let’s go step by step and compare:

---

## 🔹 1. Inputs (what they used vs. what you have)

* **Paper (KAZR):**

  * Reflectivity (Ze)
  * Doppler velocity (Vd)
  * Gradient of Doppler velocity (dVd)

* **You (DPR):**

  * `zFactorMeasured` → Reflectivity (Ze)
  * You don’t have Doppler velocity.
  * But you **do** have **two frequencies** (Ku and Ka, last dimension in shape `[..., 2]`). That can act like extra channels.
  * You can also compute **vertical gradient of reflectivity** (∆Ze/∆h) as an extra channel, which partly mimics what they did with dVd.

👉 So your input can be 2 or 3 channels:

* **Option A:** Ku Ze only.
* **Option B:** Ku Ze + Ka Ze.
* **Option C:** Ku Ze + Ka Ze + gradient(Ze).

## 🔹 2. Labels (ground truth melting layer)

* **Paper:** Annotated melting layer masks manually.
* **You:** Already have automated labels in DPR:

  * `flagBB` → tells if melting layer is present.
  * `heightBB` → where the bright band is.
  * Sometimes DPR products also have `binBBTop`, `binBBBottom` → direct layer boundaries.
* From these, you can **build binary masks**:

  * Mask = 1 between top and bottom bins of bright band.
  * Mask = 0 elsewhere.

👉 That gives you segmentation masks like the paper’s annotated labels.

---

## 🔹 3. Preprocessing

You can follow the same strategy:

* Convert `(time, beam, vertical_bins, channels)` into **2D “radar images”**:

  * Vertical axis = bins (height).
  * Horizontal axis = time (scans).
  * Channels = Ku/Ka Ze (+ optional gradient).
* Normalize Ze to \[-1, 1].
* Pad/resample to fixed size (e.g., 256×256).
* Mask invalid values (fill = -9999 → set to -1).

---

## 🔹 4. Model

* Use the same **U-Net segmentation architecture**.
* Input: (height × time × channels).
* Output: binary mask (melting layer region).
* Loss: BCE + Dice (same as paper).

---

## 🔹 5. Training

* Split dataset **temporally** (first 85% train, then val/test).
* Augment with **horizontal flips (time axis)**.
* Train with RMSProp optimizer.
* Use **dropout at inference** (MC dropout) for uncertainty, same as paper.

---

## 🔹 6. Evaluation

* Compute **Dice coefficient** for pixel-level overlap.
* From the mask, extract **upper/lower boundaries** → compare with `heightBB` or `binBBTop`/`binBBBottom`.
* Compute skill scores: POD, CSI, HSS.

---

## ✅ Bottom line

Yes, you can **do the same experiment** with your DPR dataset.

* Inputs = `zFactorMeasured` (Ku/Ka reflectivity) → normalized, formatted as 2D images.
* Labels = masks built from `flagBB` + `heightBB` (or top/bottom bins if available).
* Model = U-Net segmentation.
* Training/evaluation pipeline = same as the paper.

---

⚠️ The only limitation: you don’t have Doppler velocity.
But using **Ka + Ku reflectivity + gradient** is a strong substitute, because the bright band is very visible in reflectivity profiles.

---

👉 Do you want me to show you **exact code** for step (2) → building masks from your `flagBB` and `heightBB`, so that you get label images like the paper? That’s the critical part before training.
